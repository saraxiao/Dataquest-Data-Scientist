## 1. Writing More Complex Queries ##




## 2. Subqueries ##


select Major, Unemployment_rate from recent_grads
where Unemployment_rate < 
(select AVG(Unemployment_rate) from recent_grads)
order by Unemployment_rate

## 3. Subquery In SELECT ##


SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) as float)/CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) from recent_grads) as float) proportion_abv_avg from recent_grads
WHERE ShareWomen > 
(SELECT AVG(ShareWomen) from recent_grads)

## 4. Returning Multiple Results In Subqueries ##


SELECT Major, Major_category FROM recent_grads
WHERE Major_category IN (select Major_category from recent_grads
group by Major_category
order by SUM(Total) DESC
limit 5)

## 5. Building Complex Subqueries ##


select AVG(cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float)) avg_ratio from recent_grads

## 6. Practice Integrating A Subquery With The Outer Query ##


select Major, Major_category, cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float) ratio from recent_grads
where ratio > (select AVG(cast(Sample_size as float)/cast(Total as float)) avg_ratio from recent_grads)
